# P0C-Requirements

Implement the following features using declarative solutions, update the data model as required. Given your prior postal custom data model, implement the following custom Trigger solutions that have tests to support. One of each declarative and **two** reasonable triggers would suffice. Due Monday Week 4.

##	Workflow
*	Whenever a new account is created, create a task to reach out and welcome them.
##	Approval Process 
*	When a package has insurance and it is listed as missing require an approval process to issue a payout if the value is over $100, and multiple approvers if over $1000.
##	Process Builder
*	Whenever a contact is created, if there is no account related to it, create an account based off the contact information.
##	Flow
*	Create a flow that walks a user through the creation of a contact while providing guidance and allow the users to optionally create a related account.
##	Trigger
*	Whenever a contact is made, check to see if its details match an existing account, if it does relate the two unless an account for it already exists.
##  Tests
* Create tests that cover the trigger and handlers.
##	Presentation
*	As a part of the overall presentation, show how each of the above execute in relation to each other during the order of execution.
